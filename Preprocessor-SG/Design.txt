Design1: Use #pragma for most input parameters that is needed to robustify.

Need pragma for:
	a. Finite difference equation:
		Wrap the region where it is located.
	b. Problem type:
		eg: -Time dependent -influenced by time source or not.
		     -Time independent.
	c. Problem size:
		-# dimensions
		-range in each dimension, 
	d. Kernel size.
		- in each dimension.
	
	Optional:
	a. Metric- L2 norm ? 
	b. Alpha- Rate at which changes metric changes.
	c. Beta- Relaxation factor for alpha.
	d. 



 

Design2: Use #pragma in the region where loops are written and script extracts info on it's own.
	a. Finite difference equation. 
		Wrap the region where it is located.
	b. Problem type
		eg: Time dependent -influenced by time source or not; time independent.
	
	Optional:
	a. Metric- L2 norm ? 
	b. Alpha- Rate at which changes metric changes.
	c. Beta- Relaxation factor for alpha.
