	 Considering accepted node: 0 and it's current viable node is: 1 and the edge b/n them has a weight of 1
	 Viable node: 1 is accepted! since D[v2]: 1000000000 is greater than 1

	 Yay! destination_notfound is 1
	 Considering accepted node: 1 and it's current viable node is: 0 and the edge b/n them has a weight of 1
	 Yay! destination_notfound is 1
	 Considering accepted node: 1 and it's current viable node is: 2 and the edge b/n them has a weight of 1
	 Viable node: 2 is accepted! since D[v2]: 1000000000 is greater than 2

	 Yay! destination_notfound is 1
	 Considering accepted node: 2 and it's current viable node is: 1 and the edge b/n them has a weight of 1
	 Yay! destination_notfound is 1
	 Considering accepted node: 2 and it's current viable node is: 3 and the edge b/n them has a weight of 2
	 Viable node: 3 is accepted! since D[v2]: 1000000000 is greater than 4

	 Yay! destination_notfound is 0

	 Result: 4
